Title: Lightly anonymize and deanonymize datasets for quasi-public distribution
Description: Many times, one might like to distribute results via The Cloud 
             before they are necessarily static enough to deposit in, say, SRA.
             Of course, for general use, one might want to obscure identifying
             features of the data, lest data leakage harm a study participant,
             or more generally to keep things semi-private before publication.
             The rehash package offers implementations to lightly anonymize 
             SummarizedExperiments, MultiAssayExperiments, and BSseq objects, 
             as well as tools for GPG-encrypted transfer of decoder objects.
