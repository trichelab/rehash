Title: Lightly anonymize and deanonymize datasets for quasi-public distribution
Description: Suppose you have a few thousand samples with a few thousand
             features measured in a few assays. It would be nice to distribute
             these results via The Cloud, but once something is available on
             the Internet, it may as well be permanent. Thus it would be nice
             to obscure any identifying features of the data, lest some sort of
             overlooked data leakage might harm a participant in the study, or 
             more generally, to keep things semi-private prior to publication. 
             Another possibility is that samples could be mislabeled, or assays
             corrupt, or any of a number of other possible pitfalls. Breaking 
             direct dependencies upon human-readable identifiers for stored
             datasets can help cope with all of the above, and make cloud-based 
             data distribution less stressful, by providing both an encoder and
             decoder ring for the data, as well as semantically separating the 
             sample-level, assay-level, and feature-level covariates from the 
             deidentified assay data (the latter typically the largest file).
             This approach works with remote and local data, in-core and also 
             out-of-core. The 'rehash' package provides implementations for 
             quasi-anonymizing SummarizedExperiments, SingleCellExperiments,
             and BSseq objects, as well as recovering the above (given a meta-
             data key and, optionally, appropriately keyed covariates).
