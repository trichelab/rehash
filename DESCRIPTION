Title: Lightly anonymize and deanonymize datasets for quasi-public distribution
Description: Many times, one might like to distribute results via The Cloud 
             before they are necessarily static enough to deposit in, say, SRA.
             Of course, once something is available on the Internet, it may as 
             well be permanent. Thus it would be nice to obscure any identifying
             features of the data, lest data leakage harm a study participant,
             or more generally to keep things semi-private before publication.
             Breaking direct dependencies upon human-readable identifiers for
             datasets can help cope with this, and also encourage iterative QC,
             by data, as well as semantically separating sample-, assay-, and 
             feature-level covariates from the deidentified assay data. This 
             approach works with local and remote data, in-core and out-of-core.
             The rehash package offers implementations to lightly anonymize 
             SummarizedExperiments, SingleCellExperiments, and BSseq objects, 
             as well as recovering the above, given a meta-data key and, 
             optionally, appropriately keyed covariates. The package also 
             includes some utilities for matching existing semi-private data
             sets with fully public resources such as those in the recount
             package, thereby expanding both distribution and comparison to 
             essentially all available data of a given type, while easing the
             transition of a project from local private data to published,
             internet-accessible evidence upon which others may build.
